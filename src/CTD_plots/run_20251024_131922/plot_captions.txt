ATLAS MUON TRACKING MODEL EVALUATION - HIT FILTERING STAGE
================================================================================

ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis evaluates the hit filtering stage of a two-stage graph neural
network model for muon track reconstruction in the ATLAS detector at
High-Luminosity LHC conditions. The model processes simulated proton-proton
collisions at ‚àös = 14 TeV with an average pileup of <Œº> = 200, using events
containing muons from tùë°ÃÑ, J/œà, and Z‚ÜíŒºŒº processes with pT > 5 GeV.

The two-stage architecture consists of: (1) a hit filtering stage that
reduces combinatorial background by classifying detector hits as signal or
noise, and (2) a tracking stage that performs hit-to-track assignment and
simultaneously reconstructs track parameters (Œ∑, œÜ, pT) and classifies the
muon charge sign. The following plots assess the hit filtering stage,
which serves to reduce data volume by >99%% while retaining signal hits.

Uncertainty quantification for binomial proportions (hit classification)
uses Clopper-Pearson 95%% confidence intervals, which provide exact coverage
guarantees for finite sample sizes, ensuring statistically rigorous
uncertainty estimates.

FIGURE CAPTIONS
================================================================================

Figure 1: ROC Curve for Hit Classification
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Receiver operating characteristic curve showing true positive rate
(signal efficiency) versus false positive rate for hit classification.
The area under the curve (AUC) quantifies overall discrimination between
signal and background hits.


Figure 2: Background Rejection vs. Hit Purity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background rejection rate as a function of hit purity (precision) for
varying signal efficiency thresholds (indicated by color scale). The red
cross marks the 99%% efficiency working point used in the analysis.


Figure 3: Hit Efficiency vs. Hit Purity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hit efficiency (recall) versus hit purity (precision) as classification
threshold varies. The red cross indicates the 99%% efficiency operating
point selected to balance signal retention and background suppression.


Figure 4: Inverse Background Efficiency vs. Hit Efficiency
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Signal efficiency versus inverse background efficiency (1/Œµ_background),
displayed on a logarithmic scale to emphasize background rejection
capability. The red cross marks the 99%% efficiency working point.


Figure 5: Truth Muon pT Distribution
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Distribution of truth muon transverse momentum (pT) in the evaluation
dataset, shown on a logarithmic scale. This distribution reflects the
combined contributions from tùë°ÃÑ, J/œà‚ÜíŒºŒº, and Z‚ÜíŒºŒº processes.


Figure 6: Truth Muon Œ∑ Distribution
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Distribution of truth muon pseudorapidity (Œ∑) in the evaluation dataset,
shown on a logarithmic scale. The distribution spans the muon spectrometer
acceptance range.


Figure 7: Truth Muon œÜ Distribution
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Distribution of truth muon azimuthal angle (œÜ) in the evaluation dataset,
shown on a logarithmic scale. A uniform distribution is expected in œÜ.


Figure 8: Event 50100 Display - Before Filtering
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Transverse (X-Y) projection of all reconstructed hits in event
50100 before hit filtering. Colored lines represent true
muon track trajectories, while gray points show background hits from
detector noise and pileup interactions.


Figure 9: Event 50100 Display - After Filtering
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Transverse (X-Y) projection of event 50100 after applying
the hit filter at 99%% signal efficiency. Background suppression is evident,
while the muon track structure (colored lines) is preserved.
