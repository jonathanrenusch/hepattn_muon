Validation script to demonstrate the station index masking bug in evaluate_task1_hit_track_assignment.py

This script compares the correct masking behavior (single bracket) vs the buggy behavior (double bracket)

print("""
The bug in evaluate_task1_hit_track_assignment.py:

Lines 231 and 259 use:
    true_station_index[[track_mask]]  ← WRONG (double bracket)

Should be:
    true_station_index[track_mask]    ← CORRECT (single bracket)

Impact:
- Double bracket creates nested indexing that doesn't properly filter stations
- This causes the station count logic to use ALL station indices, not just the track's
- Result: Nearly all tracks appear to meet the "3 stations with 3+ hits" requirement
- Explains why task1 shows ~90% pass rate vs ~40% in the hit filter script

The hit filter script correctly uses single bracket indexing at lines 125-126, which
is why it shows the correct ~40% pass rate.
