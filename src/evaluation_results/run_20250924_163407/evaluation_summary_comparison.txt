ATLAS MUON HIT FILTER EVALUATION - COMPARATIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-24 16:50:44
Max events processed: 10000

BASELINE FILTERING CRITERIA:
- Tracks must have hits in at least 3 different stations
- Each station must have at least 3 hits from the track
- This ensures tracks have at least 9 hits total
- Detector acceptance: 0.1 <= |eta| <= 2.7
- Minimum pT threshold: >= 3 GeV

BASELINE FILTERING STRATEGY:
- Keep ALL noise hits from all events in both categories
- BASELINE: Keep true hits from tracks meeting baseline criteria
- REJECTED: Keep true hits from tracks NOT meeting baseline criteria
- This maintains realistic signal-to-noise ratio for both evaluations

==================================================
BASELINE FILTERING BREAKDOWN
==================================================
Total tracks evaluated: 17,712
Tracks failing minimum hits (>=9): 166 (0.94%)
Tracks failing eta cuts (0.1 <= |eta| <= 2.7): 527 (2.98%)
Tracks failing pT cuts (pT >= 3 GeV): 0 (0.00%)
Tracks failing station cuts (>=3 stations, >=3 hits/station): 9,405 (53.10%)
Tracks passing ALL criteria: 7,614 (42.99%)
