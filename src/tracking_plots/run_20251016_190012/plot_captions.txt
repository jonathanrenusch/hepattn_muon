ATLAS MUON TRACKING MODEL EVALUATION - TRACKING STAGE
================================================================================

ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis evaluates the tracking stage of a two-stage graph neural
network model for muon track reconstruction in the ATLAS detector at
High-Luminosity LHC conditions. The model processes simulated proton-proton
collisions at √s = 14 TeV with an average pileup of <μ> = 200, using events
containing muons from t𝑡̄, J/ψ, and Z→μμ processes with pT > 5 GeV.

The two-stage architecture consists of: (1) a hit filtering stage that
reduces combinatorial background by classifying detector hits as signal or
noise, and (2) a tracking stage that performs hit-to-track assignment and
simultaneously reconstructs track parameters (η, φ, pT) and classifies the
muon charge sign. The following plots assess the tracking stage performance.

Uncertainty quantification uses Clopper-Pearson 99.7%% confidence intervals
(~3σ) for all binomial proportions, including pooled hit assignment
efficiency and purity (calculated across all hits in each η bin), charge
classification accuracy, and double matching efficiency. The Clopper-Pearson
method provides exact coverage guarantees for finite sample sizes, ensuring
statistically rigorous and conservative uncertainty estimates appropriate for
particle physics applications.

Figure 1: Hit Assignment Efficiency and Purity vs Pseudorapidity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pooled hit assignment efficiency (blue circles) and purity (green squares)
as a function of truth muon pseudorapidity η. Efficiency is calculated as
the ratio of total correct hits to total true hits across all tracks in
each bin. Purity is the ratio of total correct hits to total predicted
hits. Error bars represent 99.7%% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals.


Figure 2: Double Matching Efficiency vs Pseudorapidity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fraction of tracks satisfying both efficiency ≥ 50%% and purity ≥ 50%%
criteria as a function of truth pseudorapidity η. This metric requires
bidirectional consistency between hit-to-track and track-to-hits
assignments. Error bars show 99.7%% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals.


Figure 3: Charge Classification Accuracy vs Pseudorapidity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy of muon charge sign classification (±1) as a function of truth
pseudorapidity η. Error bars represent 99.7%% Clopper-Pearson confidence
intervals for the binomial proportion of correctly classified tracks.


Figure 4: Transverse Momentum Distribution Comparison
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison of predicted (red) and truth (blue) transverse momentum
distributions for reconstructed muon tracks. Agreement between the two
distributions indicates unbiased pT estimation across the kinematic range.
