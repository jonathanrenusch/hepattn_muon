ATLAS MUON TRACKING MODEL EVALUATION - TRACKING STAGE
================================================================================

ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis evaluates the tracking stage of a two-stage graph neural
network model for muon track reconstruction in the ATLAS detector at
High-Luminosity LHC conditions. The model processes simulated proton-proton
collisions at √s = 14 TeV with an average pileup of <μ> = 200, using events
containing muons from t𝑡̄, J/ψ, and Z→μμ processes with pT > 5 GeV.

The two-stage architecture consists of: (1) a hit filtering stage that
reduces combinatorial background by classifying detector hits as signal or
noise, and (2) a tracking stage that performs hit-to-track assignment and
simultaneously reconstructs track parameters (η, φ, pT) and classifies the
muon charge sign. The following plots assess the tracking stage performance.

Uncertainty quantification uses standard error of the mean for continuous
metrics (hit assignment efficiency and purity) and Clopper-Pearson 95%%
confidence intervals for binomial proportions (charge classification
accuracy). The Clopper-Pearson method provides exact coverage guarantees
for finite sample sizes, ensuring statistically rigorous uncertainty
estimates.

FIGURE CAPTIONS
================================================================================

Figure 1: Hit Assignment Efficiency and Purity vs Pseudorapidity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mean hit assignment efficiency (blue circles) and purity (green squares)
as a function of truth muon pseudorapidity η. Efficiency quantifies the
fraction of true hits correctly assigned to each track, while purity
measures the fraction of assigned hits that are correct. Error bars
represent the standard error of the mean.


Figure 2: Double Matching Efficiency vs Pseudorapidity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fraction of tracks satisfying both efficiency ≥ 50%% and purity ≥ 50%%
criteria as a function of truth pseudorapidity η. This metric requires
bidirectional consistency between hit-to-track and track-to-hits
assignments. Error bars show 95%% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals.


Figure 3: Charge Classification Accuracy vs Pseudorapidity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy of muon charge sign classification (±1) as a function of truth
pseudorapidity η. Error bars represent 95%% Clopper-Pearson confidence
intervals for the binomial proportion of correctly classified tracks.


Figure 4: Transverse Momentum Distribution Comparison
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison of predicted (red) and truth (blue) transverse momentum
distributions for reconstructed muon tracks. Agreement between the two
distributions indicates unbiased pT estimation across the kinematic range.
